#Exposition 
The party finds the town of [[Zetalé]] riddled with a [[Disease|disease]], and are asked to find a cure.
-   A [[Ratfolk Warlock|ratfolk warlock]] who worships Reshef has been using [[Rats|rats]] and the [[Well|well]] water to spread the disease.
-   The cure can only be made by analysing the patient zero - the ratfolk warlock's brother.

Reward:
- 750gp

Foreshadowing:
- The ratfolk warlock has a pendant of the [[Slavers|slaver’s]] ring, which will be owned by any of the slavers in level 4.
- The ratfolk warlock will be selling its creations to the [[Lich|lich]], and so will have a stamped letter in arcane markings from the lich.
