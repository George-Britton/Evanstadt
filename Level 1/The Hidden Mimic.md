#Location
A tavern in [[Evanstadt]] where the gimmick is a toothless mimic called Bobby that hides somewhere in the tavern.

Tavern NPCs:
- Quincy Calmant - Barman
- Bella Mossberry - Merchant
- Logran Stronghart - Wrestler (+3 Strength)
- [[Dash McKenna]] - Gunslinger

Games:
- Avandra's Favour
	- Players roll 2d6. If they add to a 7 or 12, the player wins. Gamblers can double the bet to add 1d6 to the total.

- The Long Embrace:
	- Two participants put in a bet, and clasp hands together like an arm wrestle, with a live scorpion in between. A coin is flipped to see who it stings, and they must make a DC 11 CON saving throw, or let go and lose.

- Dragon Dice (any buy-in)
	- A D20 is rolled each in secret, then a d12, then a d6. The highest total wins, but there are certain dice combos that beat that: 20+12+6, then 666, 555 etc, down to 111. Players can raise after each round.

- Statue Maker:
	- Any number of participants buy in with 10gp. They are put in an arena with a sleeping basalisk, and must take turns throwing rocks as close as they can, without hitting and waking it up. If they hit, they are petrified by the basilisk, and it is sent back to sleep. The last unpetrified wins the pot. ![](https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/185/377/315/636252762168821795.jpeg)
