#Exposition 
The mayor of [[Evanstadt]] has fallen ill, and her aide offers a large reward for the ingredients of the medicine

Ingredients:
-   Venomsac of a [[Pseudodragon]]
-   Beak of a [[Hippogriff]]


Reward:
-   120 per ingredient   
-   1 free item from [[Evanstadt NPCs|Mossberryâ€™s]] up to 20gp value each

Foreshadowing:
-   The [[Evanstadt|town]] would usually send their [[Mining Crew|mining crew]], as they are acclimated to the mountains, but they are taking far longer than expected to finish a current job outside town, and so the town must call upon its people.
-   The town will have rats here and there as a foreshadowing to the [[Ratfolk Warlock|ratfolk warlock]] in level 3.
