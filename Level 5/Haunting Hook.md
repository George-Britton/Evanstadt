#Exposition 
Foreshadowing:
-   The slaves being traded are exotic species - drow, tieflings, genasi etc. These will all turn up later in the secret ritual room of the [[Lich|lich]].
-   If questioned, [[Port Arakoon NPCs|Valmir]] will say that all she knows about who she was sold to is that he's based in [[Evanstadt]]
-   The lich in level 5 will have a pendant of the slavers ring.
